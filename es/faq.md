## Who produces the AV Artifact Atlas?

We do! AVAA is a community resource. It was started by the [Stanford Media Preservation Lab](https://lib.stanford.edu/stanford-media-preservation-lab/) and [New York University](http://dlib.nyu.edu/dlts/), using examples of artifacts gathered in their digitization work. The [Bay Area Video Coalition](http://www.bavc.org) led a project in 2013-2014 to enhance the Atlas. [Ashley Blewer](http://ashleyblewer.com/) managed the site's migration from its original Wikimedia platform to GitHub.

## How can I edit or contribute content?

We welcome contributors! Please see our [contributor's guide]({{ site.baseurl }}/contributors_guide.html), which is currently a work in progress. If there are steps that are unclear, please feel free to let us know via the issues [tracker](https://github.com/bavc/avaa/issues).

## Why doesn't AVAA contain artifacts from motion picture film?

We need examples! AV Artifact Atlas was initiated by archivists who work primarily with video and audio, so it's a little lacking in the film department. If you have a film artifact to share, please do! See [contributor's guide]({{ site.baseurl }}/contributors_guide.html) or send us an issue on the [tracker](https://github.com/bavc/avaa/issues).

## What is the AVAA's Copyright Statement?

Read all about AVAA and copyright [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/copyrights.html).

## I'm new to GitHub. Where can I learn more about how to use it?

There are many resources on the web for learning git and GitHub. [Hello World](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) is a well-known guide for the beginner.

If you'd like to learn how to update AVAA from the command line on your local machine, we recommend this [user-friendly manual](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/) from Roger Dudler.

GitHub has a great [cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) that can get you started with the language used in Markdown (.md) files. "Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers." [Gruber 2004](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).
