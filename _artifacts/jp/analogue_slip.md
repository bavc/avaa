The «original» film strip has slipped in the gate at a cement splice during the photochemical printing.

## Can it be fixed?

Not in the actual print, because usually not all images are fully present. A new print should be made, alternatively the «original» digitised instead of the print. In the present example the print can be digitally restored up to one frame which is incomplete.

## Example(s)
