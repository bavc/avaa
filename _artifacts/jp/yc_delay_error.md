When video suffers from Y/C delay error, there will be a mismatch in the timing among the luminance and/or color channels, with resulting visible misalignment in how colors appear in the monitor. A misalignment of Y/C shows a blurry edge around areas with high contrast color difference, and will be most apparent around sharp edges of objects in the video image.

## Can it be fixed?

Yes, some [VTR integrated or stand-alone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_base_correction) time base correctors have Y/C adjustment capability.

## Example(s)

<sub>In the enlarged detail boxes above, you can see a white edge along the reporter's yellow jeans, as well as a green hue around the orange drop shadow in the lettering on the sign behind them. This is caused by misaligned Y and C components in the video signal. The error is corrected in the image below.</sub>
