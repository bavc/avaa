In footage with very fast motion, block noise can occur when the difference between two fields creates deficiencies in encoding. If there is too much difference between two adjacent fields during recording, they are compressed independently and some detail in the image is lost due to the reallocation of available bits.

## Can it be fixed?

No, block noise cannot be remedied.
