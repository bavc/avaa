The artifact below is exhibited as fine-patterned, light diagonal lines scrolling in the monitor. It is caused by RF interference in cabling, which can include AM radio signals. This RFI is exacerbated by electrical ground loop.

## Can it be fixed?

If ground loop problems are recorded in the video or audio signal, they are only correctable through re-transfer of the content without the electrical anomalies in the system. Usually, this involves powering all devices in the video system using one source of electricity with all outlets serving power with minimal difference in ground potential.
