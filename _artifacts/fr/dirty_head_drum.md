Dirty or deteriorating video tape can leave foreign material on the tape path around the head drum. The building up foreign materials will distort the tape, causing poor head-to-tape contact and in turn causing visible errors in the video signal. The example included here comes from a U-matic tape, and appears as a grainy and discolored line across the frame. This error may look different across different tape formats. 

## Can it be fixed?

Cleaning the tape path of your VTR and cleaning the media may help reduce this artifact. 

## Example(s)

<sub>This example shows a dirty head drum error on a U-matic tape. The error is visible across the antire frame, and appears right under David Hockney's chin.</sub>
