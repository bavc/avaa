PCM F1 Audio without Adaptor refers to a digtial audio signal that is recorded onto an analog video tape. It appears as grey and black blocks that scroll vertically across the screen and looks similar to a barcode. It can appear on any video format, but is most frequently seen on U-matic and Betamax tapes. The [Sony PCM-1600/1610/1630](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCM_adaptor) adaptor were most commonly used with U-matic, and the Sony PCM-F1 adaptor with Betamax.

[According to greatbear](http://www.thegreatbear.net/audio-tape/early-digital-tape-recordings-umatic-betamax-video-tape/), this hybrid analog/digital system was the first two-channel stereo digital recording process, combining the transport and recording mechanisms of the VTR with a PCM (pulse-code-modulation) digital processor. Remarkably, this set the precedent for the 44.1 kHz audio sampling rate that was used with CD recording.

## Can it be fixed?

Yes. It can be fixed by adding the appropriate adaptor to your video signal chain.
