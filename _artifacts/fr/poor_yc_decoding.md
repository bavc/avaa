A combination of inferior materials and poor shielding in S-Video cabling can produce the checkerboard pattern seen in these images. It is the result of poor multiplexing of the video components carried in an S-Video output signal.

## Can it be fixed?

Yes, well-shielded, high-quality S-Video cables will eliminate this artifact. This is especially important in a space where there is a lot of RF.
