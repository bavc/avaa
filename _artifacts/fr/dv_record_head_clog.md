This artifact may be the result of a clogged record head when taping over a recycled piece of tape. Even a small piece of debris might reduce head-to-tape contact during recording, causing signal dropout (if using virgin stock) or an artifact like the one shown here. If there is a previous program recorded, it will remain on the section of tape that passed through the transport during the occurrence of the head clog.

## Can it be fixed?

There is no remedy for this artifact, as it is recorded into the tape media. The only way to avoid this problem is to keep the camera record heads clean and always use new tape.
