Chrominance noise can be identified as traces and specks of color in an otherwise clear picture. It is most visible in dark, saturated areas of the video image. It can be due to limitations of [CCD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charge-coupled_device) sensitivity in video cameras (i.e., low-lighting conditions during camera recording), over-boosting of chrominance in the video signal, or the use of poor video processors. Multi-generation composite dubs may suffer from high levels of chrominance noise.

## Can it be fixed?

Like [Luminance Noise]({{ site.baseurl }}/artifacts/luminance_noise.html), if the video output has been properly adjusted for playback, there is not an acceptable fix for this problem in preservation workflows.
