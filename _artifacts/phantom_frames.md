A phantom frame is a very dark frame. One can hardly recognise more than the perforation, when an overscan is done. This happens when the light flash is not properly synchronised with reading the sensor's data, and is not the same than a black frame.

It may depend on the OS and its configuration (switching off all the not-needed graphic features often helps).

## Can it be fixed?

Once it's in the file, usually not.

## Example(s)
