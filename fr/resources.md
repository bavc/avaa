* [_Audiovisual Self-Assessment Program (AvSAP)_](http://www.library.illinois.edu/prescons/projects_grants/grants/avsap/index.html)  
&quot;AvSAP (Audiovisual Self-Assessment Program) exists to assist cultural heritage institutions with audiovisual materials in their collections and staff who have little to no training in audiovisual preservation. AvSAP is also an excellent tool for those with experience with AV materials and its informational and advisory components can help fill out areas where the AV preservation expert could use some refreshers. Our goal is to help collections managers develop a prioritized preservation plan as well as educate them on extending the lives of their collections with the resources at hand. The scope of material AvSAP covers are: film, videotape (open-reel and cartridge based; analog and digital), audio recordings (extending from cylinder grooved media to disc; analog and digital) and optical media such as CD and DVD. AvSAP does not address issues related to still photographic processes or prints.&quot;
