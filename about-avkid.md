AVKID (Audio Video Known Issues Data) is a new initiative to gather a corpus of “known issues” found with equipment commonly used in A/V preservation efforts. The focus is on subsiding the loss of knowledge that technicians and professionals might have that are documented informally in forums, databases, and brains across the globe. 


## Why AVAA?

With the calls we often hear about having limited time and limited resources, to preserve a lot of the information on the A/V Material we work with, this work will get done more quickly and create better and more sound results if these issues are effectively documented instead of discussed at conferences and in the nooks and crannies of the internet.
